# odin-recipes- README-FILE

    Hello i am Darell Serrano
    This Readme-file will consist of a new project that will consist of 2 programming languages.  Currently those two will be html & CSS. Once the project is completed i will have demonstrated my learning on the fly skills and dedication to growing my knowledge. The project will end with it been a junior Recipe website and/or webpage.

    As i continue developing this project i will continue adding updates with each new addition. I will also be using this Readme-file as a way too keep notes and keep records of mistakes ive made and how i fixed them. I believe this will help me learn and help others in the future.

    So i havent updaated this README-File but i have recently made a lot of changes. At first i started out creating many links and many recipes but i eventually realized i should focus mainly on quality rather then quantity. 

    After messing around a bit making a miss , bug fixes , incorrect code, and weird border messes i have decided to make a cleaner looking recipe page that fits within a medium collapsed window.

    The main front webpage can fill the entire webpage, but i focused on making it look simple and clean.

    Second the first link leading to my fall of the bone recipe is a recipe i have personally done myself. I wanted to make this look a bit stylish and easy to look at. If i had a cunsomer using my rib recipe I would like them to enjoy the layout of the recipe and enjoy the recipe , unlike many pages now flooded with so many ads you cant tel whether you are learning and following the recipe correctly.

    My Lasagna Recipe is one of my favorite foods. I would wnat consumers to return and memorize my recipe as its fun and easy to read.

    Last but not least my final recipe includes a spaghetti and meatballs recipe which I personally enjoy and can always go to if I want a yummy filling meal. I wanted this recipe to be the biggest and most full-filling recipe as its more custom made when it comes to the meatballs allowing you to make it more personal while cooking at home. Creating your own handmade meatballs can bring you closer to your meal once your on munching away at this delicious recipe.


    Thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this rammbling. I am Darell Serrano and this is one of my first official side beginning projects and, I'm excited for my future projects beyond this one. I'll see you on the other side.
